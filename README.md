# New-York-Taxi-Price-Prediction


New York taxi price prediction using machine learning and linear regression involves using historical data on taxi trips and associated prices to build a predictive model. Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (in this case, taxi fares,pickup time, pickup lantitude & longitude, passenger count, etc.) and one or more independent variables (such as distance traveled, time of day, and location). The resulting model can be used to predict the fare for a given trip based on the values of these independent variables. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data and can be integrated into a real-world application.
